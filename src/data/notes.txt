An app was designed for shoppers to try-on socks using their phone or tablet.
By pointing the camera at one's feet, machine learning and augmented reality
fit and position the socks on each foot. Additionally, the app can measure
one's foot down to a millimeter of accuracy.
Cataloging, filter + search, and discovery of products are also designed into the concept.
